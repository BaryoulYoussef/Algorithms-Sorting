    "## Gap-Based Generalization of Insertion Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation uses the ShellSort algorithm, which is an **in-place comparison-based sorting algorithm** and a generalization of insertion sort. ShellSort improves insertion sort by allowing exchanges of elements that are far apart, using a **gap sequence**. Initially, elements that are `gap` positions apart are compared and sorted using a gapped insertion sort. The gap is gradually reduced (commonly halved each time) until it becomes 1, at which point a standard insertion sort finalizes the ordering.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Complexity:**  \n",
    "- Worst Case: O(n²) for simple gap sequences (like n/2, n/4, …)  \n",
    "- Average Case: ~O(n^(3/2)) with optimized sequences  \n",
    "- Best Case: O(n) if the array is already nearly sorted  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Space Complexity:** O(1) - sorts the array in-place  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical Note:** The algorithm works by reducing the gap and performing a gapped insertion sort at each step. The final pass with a gap of 1 ensures the array is fully sorted.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Advantage:** Faster than simple insertion sort for medium-sized arrays due to early movement of elements over large distances.  \n",
    "**Key Disadvantage:** Not stable and performance depends on the chosen gap sequence.\n"
