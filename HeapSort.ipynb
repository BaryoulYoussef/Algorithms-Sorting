    "## Binary Heap-Based Sorting Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation uses the heap sort algorithm, which leverages the binary heap data structure. The algorithm works in two phases: first, it builds a max heap from the unsorted array by calling `siftDown` on all parent nodes from bottom to top starting at index `(len(lst)-2)//2`. Second, it repeatedly extracts the maximum element (root) by swapping it with the last element of the unsorted portion, then restores the heap property. The `siftDown` function maintains the max heap property by comparing a parent node with its children and swapping with the larger child until the node is in its correct position.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Complexity:** O(n log n) in all cases (best, average, and worst)  \n",
    "**Space Complexity:** O(1) - sorts in-place  \n",
    "**Technical Note:** Array indices represent a binary tree where for node at index `i`: left child = `2*i+1`, right child = `2*i+2`. The algorithm handles three cases in `siftDown`: both children exist, only left child exists, or no children exist (leaf node).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Advantage:** Guaranteed O(n log n) with constant space  \n",
    "**Key Disadvantage:** Not stable and slower than QuickSort in practice"
