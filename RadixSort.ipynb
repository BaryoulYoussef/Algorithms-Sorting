    "# Radix Sort Implementation\n",

    "## Digit-Based Non-Comparative Sorting Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation uses the radix sort algorithm, which sorts integers **digit by digit** starting from the **least significant digit (LSD)**. The algorithm repeatedly applies a **stable counting sort** for each digit position. Stability is crucial to ensure that numbers with the same digit retain their original relative order. The `counting_sort` function sorts the array based on a specific digit and outputs a partially sorted array for the next pass. The main `radix_sort` function determines the number of digits in the largest number and iteratively sorts by units, tens, hundreds, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Complexity:** O(d × (n + k)), where `n` = number of elements, `k` = digit range (0–9), `d` = number of digits in the largest number  \n",
    "**Space Complexity:** O(n + k) - uses an auxiliary array for counting sort  \n",
    "**Technical Note:** Radix Sort requires a **stable sort** at each digit level; here, counting sort is used for stability. The number of passes is equal to the number of digits in the largest element.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Advantage:** Stable and efficient for integers or fixed-length strings with many elements  \n",
    "**Key Disadvantage:** Requires extra space and less efficient for small datasets or non-integer data\n"
